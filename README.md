# April 2015 Moringa School HTML/CSS Workshop Official Repository
### What's in this repo?
In here you will find a list of all the materials we will be working with during the course of the workshop and some extras.

We will be working out of the Slides directory and the Exercises directory for the first half of the day.

We will then be working from the `myPersonalSite` file, where you will find a basic `index.html` file as well as a `styles` folder.

We also included an `example folder` which contains an example site with a similar file structure. 

Finally there is a `resources` file for you to reference after this workshop is complete.
