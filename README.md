# April 2015 Moringa School HTML/CSS Workshop Official Repository
### What's in this repo?

You will find a list of all the materials we will be working with during the course of the workshop and some extras.

We will mainly be working out of the `slides` directory and the `exercises` directory for the first half of the day.

If there is time, we will then be working from the `myPersonalSite` file, where you will find a basic `index.html` file as well as a `styles` directory. The `codeSamples` directory has some neat examples of useful HTML/CSS items.

The `example` directory contains an example site with a similar file structure that you can reference. 

Finally there is a `resources.txt` file for you to reference after the workshop is over.
