<!-- 
1. This page displays a gallery of photos of old computers. In this first step, add a background to the entire gallery div.
2. Add a border to all of the pictures. Try and make it look like a photo frame, if you can. Hint: try looking through border-style options.
2. Hmm... The pictures are all different sizes. Standardize their heights! Maybe 300px?
3. The photos look a bit too close to each other. Add margin to them, either on all sides or just the sides that matter to separate them.
4. The photos and title are all pushed to the left of the screen. Position everything in the center!
